# Phase One Projects

**Goal:** I want to study 4-5 sections of Jason Dion's Network+ Study course and develop personal projects that I could complete based on what I've learn. I will synthesize the information I collect through my note taking journey and community posts on personal projects to develop the early stages of a structured learning path. 

*If you are following along in this journey, the process of my discovery may not be pretty. But I hope you stick around to see me learn and develop a hands-on learning path for other self taught learners.*
