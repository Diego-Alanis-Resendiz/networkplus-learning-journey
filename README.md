# 🚀 My Route to Network+ Certification

## 👋 Introduction

### About Me

Hi! My name is **Diego**, and I'm currently working as a Security Help Desk Analyst at a cybersecurity company. I've been in tech for just about 8 months, and being immersed in the world of cybersecurity has been incredibly humbling. The more I learn, the more I realize how much I *don’t* know—and that’s what drives me.

As I deepen my understanding of cybersecurity, I’ve come to recognize that **networking concepts are a foundational pillar** of the field. That’s why I’ve set a personal goal:  
> To design and follow a custom learning path filled with **personal projects, notes, and tutorials** that support my journey to earning the **CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)** certification.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is a **living project**, where I’ll be:
- Sharing my **notes** (written in Obsidian)
- Documenting hands-on **projects**
- Posting **YouTube tutorials** that walk through each project
- Mapping each project to **Network+ exam objectives**

The goal is to create a free, evolving resource to help *you* learn alongside me.

## 📚 Study Resources

I’ll be using:
- [Professor Messer’s free YouTube Network+ course](https://www.youtube.com/user/professormesser)
- [Jason Dion’s Network+ Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-dion/)  

I chose these because they were incredibly helpful when I earned my **CompTIA A+ certification**, and they continue to provide solid, structured learning.

## 🔨 Project & Learning Phases

As I move through Jason Dion’s course structure, I’ll:
- Break the content into **phases** aligned with the exam domains
- Build projects that reinforce concepts in each phase
- Link notes and tutorials together
- Specify which **Network+ exam objectives** each project covers, so you can clearly see which concepts you're applying and strengthening

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This is not a polished, final product—it's a journey.  
I’ll be iterating, improving, and restructuring as I learn better ways to explain, teach, and build.

I hope this inspires others starting out in tech or cybersecurity to **learn by doing** and to share that learning publicly.  
Thanks for being here—and feel free to use or build on what I’m creating.
